        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <li>
            <p>Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned,
                and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few
                tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook
                until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and simmer until fork tender,
                about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until
                spinach has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve.</p>

    </ol>
